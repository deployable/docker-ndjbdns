# A non-root user whose privileges should be acquired by tinydns.

# ROOT: is the new root & working directory for tinydns.
# Obviously, the user whose ID is mentioned above MUST be able to read from
# this directory.
#
# Also, this is where `data' and `data.cdb' files should reside.

# If HIDETTL is set, tinydns always uses a TTL of 0 in its responses.
#
# HIDETTL=

# If FORWARDONLY is set, tinydns treats the servers/roots as a list of IP
# addresses for other caches, not root servers. It forwards queries to those
# caches the same way a client does, rather than contacting a chain of servers
# according to NS records.
#
# FORWARDONLY=

# If DEBUG_LEVEL is set, tinydns displays helpful debug messages to
# the console.
